# Deep Learning and Neural Network on Coursera (offered by deeplearning.ai)

## Course

This is a repository of my course's assignments' solution  This is all written in Python. The datasets are also uploaded with the exercises

## Contents
This is the first course of the Deep Learning Specialization, where you will study the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. 

By the end, you will be familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.
